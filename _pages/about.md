I am an AI researcher working on natural language processing, machine learning, and multimodal agents. I am currently leading research efforts at [Orby AI](https://orby.ai/).

My research is driven by the goal of **bringing the world's knowledge to the user's assistance**, which manifests itself in the following directions

* **How to effectively organize and use knowledge**. This involves tasks like question answering (where I have co-lead the development of some benchmarks for complex reasoning: [HotpotQA](https://hotpotqa.github.io/) and [BeerQA](https://beerqa.github.io/)), information extraction, syntactic analysis for many languages (check out [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza)), etc.
* **How to effectively communicate knowledge**. This mainly concerns interactive NLP systems such as conversational systems, where I am interested in theory-of-mind reasoning under information asymmetry (e.g., [how to ask good questions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14530.pdf) and [how to provide good answers beyond the literal answer](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.385.pdf)), offline-to-online transfer, multi-modal interactions, etc. On the application side, I co-lead the founding research team that launched [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/) at Amazon.
* **How to leverage interactive knowledge to help users better perform tasks**. This mainly concerns multimodal digital agents operating on real-world user interfaces and solving problems on behalf of users. Want to learn more? **Consider joining our research team at [Orby AI](https://orby.ai/)!**

In all of these directions, I am also excited to explore data-efficient models and training techniques, model and system explainability, and self-supervised learning techniques that enable us to address these problems.

Before joining Orby, I worked for Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an senior applied scientist, and JD.com AI Research as a senior research scientist before that. I obtained my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://cs.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu) advised by [Prof. Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning), where I was a member of the [NLP group](http://nlp.stanford.edu) and [AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/). I also obtained two Master's at Stanford (CS & Statistics), and my Bachelor's at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

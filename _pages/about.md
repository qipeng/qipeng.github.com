I am an Applied Scientist at [Amazon AWS AI](https://www.amazon.science/) working on natural language processing and machine learning.

My research is driven by the goal of **bringing the world's knowledge to the user's assistance**, which manifests itself in two main directions

* **How to effectively organize and use knowledge**. This involves tasks like question answering (where I have co-lead the development of some benchmarks for complex reasoning: [HotpotQA](https://hotpotqa.github.io/) and [BeerQA](https://beerqa.github.io/)), information extraction, syntactic analysis for many languages (check out [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza), my go-to procrastination project), etc.
* **How to effectively communicate knowledge**. This mainly concerns interactive NLP systems such as conversational systems, where I am interested in theory-of-mind reasoning under information asymmetry, offline-to-online transfer, multi-modal interactions, etc.

In these tasks, I am also excited to explore data-efficient models and training techniques, model explainability, and self-supervised learning techniques that enable us to address these problems.

Before joining Amazon, I worked for JD.com AI Research as a research scientist. I obtained my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://cs.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu) advised by [Prof. Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning), where I was a member of the [NLP group](http://nlp.stanford.edu). I also obtained two Master's at Stanford (CS & Statistics), and my Bachelor's at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

[Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) (Chinese: 拼音, _lit._ "spelling sounds") is one of the most commonly used method for romanizing Chinese characters from Mandarin Chinese, and is used for names for the majority of the Chinese community.[^1] As many find difficulty pronouncing Chinese names written in Pinyin (esp in academic conferences), I put together this cheatsheet in hope of helping (mostly American) English speakers pronounce them correctly with as little effort as possible.[^2] No training in the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) is required.


**Bottomline**: Pinyin is a romanization method for denoting Chinese characters and providing largely approximations to the actual sounds made to pronounce the characters. There is *not* a one-to-one mapping between each Latin letter (or small group of letters) and the corresponding sound, and I will not pretend that that is the case. Nevertheless, we can focus on the most challenging ones first, and strive for a better and better sound approximation.

I will organize this cheatsheet in a hierarchical manner, focusing on the first-order approximations before offering more details and exceptions.

## Vowels

1. **a** sounds like **a** in **c<u>a</u>r** or **sp<u>a</u>**, without the **r** sound in the tail.
	1. Except in **an**, where you might be better off approximating it with **b<u>a</u>n** or **c<u>a</u>t** (the vowel sounds a bit more closed than the open-mouth **a**).
2. **e** sounds like **e** in **th<u>e</u>** (when it's not pronounced like **th<u>ee</u>**) or **a** in **<u>a</u>gain** in most places.
	1. Except in diphthongs or double vowels like **ei**, **ie**, **ue** (actually **üe**, see **u**), where it sounds like **e** in **b<u>e</u>t**.
3. **i** sounds like **t<u>ea</u>** or **sh<u>ee</u>p**. It almost never sounds like **b<u>i</u>t** or **sh<u>i</u>p** as rendered in most American accents (which drifts closer to **b<u>e</u>t**).
	1. When **i** appears before another vowel, it can usually be well approximated as **<u>y</u>es**.
	2. In **zhi**, **chi**, **shi**, **ri**, **zi**, **ci**, and **si**, **i** actually doesn't sound like **sh<u>ee</u>p** and doesn't have an equivalent in English. A rough approximation is a voiced version of the consonant (i.e. hold your mouth they way you'd pronounce the consonant, and make a voice). If you speak Japanese, there are some rough correspondence: **zi** <=> **ず (zu)** and **si** <=> **す (su)**, where the correspondence is more pronounced when these syllables are at the end of a word in Japanese.
4. **o** sounds like **sh<u>o</u>rt** or **b<u>o</u>y**, again without the trailing **r** sound.
5. **u** is usually the romanization for two different vowels in Mandarin, **u** and **ü**. The former sounds like **f<u>oo</u>d** or **p<u>oo</u>l**, and the later doesn't exist in English. A good way to approximate **ü** is pronouncing the letter **<u>u</u>** in English).
	1. **u** is actually **ü** if it comes after **j**, **q**, **x**, or **y**.
	2. When **u** is not **ü** and comes before other vowels, it can usually be well approximated as **<u>w</u>ait**.
	3. Except for **j**, **q**, **x**, and **y**, the vowel **ü** can only follow **n** and **l**. To disambiguate with **u** in the latter cases (following **n** and **l**), it is sometimes romanized as **v**, and more recently, it is starting to be romanized as **yu** on Chinese passports.[^3]

### Some Less Compositional Diphthongs and Special Vowels

1. **ao** sounds like **ab<u>ou</u>t** or **m<u>ou</u>ntain** with a more closed ending than the normal **o**.
2. **iu** sounds like **tr<u>io</u>** or **grand<u>io</u>se**.
3. **er** sounds like **b<u>ir</u>d** or **sp<u>ur</u>**, with the trailing **r** sound in American English.

## Consonants

1. **j** is similar to **zh** and both sound like **<u>J</u>ohn** or **<u>dr</u>eam**, **q** is similar to **ch** and both sound like **<u>ch</u>eese** or **<u>ch</u>owder**, and **x** is similar to **sh** and both sound like **<u>sh</u>eep** or **<u>sh</u>op**.
	1. One good approximation for **j**, **q**, and **x** is actually appending a **y** sound to **zh**, **ch**, and **sh**, because Mandarin pronunciation rules mandate a **y** sound after these most of the time and it's not always marked explicitly (think **xia** vs **sha**, and **xu** vs **shu**).
2. **c** sounds like **pan<u>ts</u>** or **boo<u>ts</u>**.
3. All other consonants sound very much like their English counterparts, but note that **h** is never silent (in fact no consonant is silent in Pinyin).
	1. To be more precise, **r** actually sounds more like **vi<u>s</u>ion** than **<u>r</u>oot**, basically the latter but with the tongue curled upward against the top of the mouth.
	2. A very subtle difference I realized while compiling this cheatsheet is that most leading consonants in Mandarin are voiceless but some of their counterparts in English are voiced. This distinction probably makes very little difference to the untrained ear, but might be of interest to the IPA inducted.

## Segmentation and Sandhi

The Pinyin corresponding to each Chinese character is usually of the form **CVC**, where one or more **v**owels are surrounded by a leading **c**onsonant and a trailing one. Either or both consonants can be missing in some cases, and when that results in ambiguation in pronunciation, an apostrophe or a hyphen is usually used to delimit character boundaries (e.g., **Tian'anmen**). The trailing consonant can only be either **n** or **ng**.

Some special cases in segmentation:

1. **zhi**, **chi**, **shi**, **ri**, **zi**, **ci**, and **si** cannot be followed by other vowels or trailing consonants.

Although there is [tone sandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_sandhi) in Chinese, there isn't as much [sandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhi) of other sorts in Chinese, meaning boundaries between Chinese characters are clearly reflected in speech. Take **Tian'anmen** for an example, while the first instinct of most English speakers might be to say **tian-**&lt;short pause&gt;**-na-men**, a native speaker would say **tian-an-men** without mushing character boundaries.[^4]

## Tones

There are four tones (plus a neutral tone) in Mandarin, and I believe [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Tones) is truly the best material on this one. Most Chinese speakers can recognize your speech without perfect tones, given that you map sounds roughly correctly and are careful with segmentation and sandhi, though.

## Tying It All Together

[Matt Gardner](https://twitter.com/nlpmattg) suggested on Twitter that it would be helpful to include some examples, so I am including some examples here that feature some of the awesome people I know (plus yours truly) whose name are romanized in pinyin when they appear in publications. Try pronuncing their names with what you've learned:

| Pinyin  | Pronunciation |
|---------|---------------|
| Peng Qi | _p-uh-ng ch-ee_, where _uh_=**<u>a</u>gain**, and _ee_=**b<u>ee</u>**.|
| Yuhao Zhang | _y-u how zh-ah-ng_, where _y-u_=pronouncing the English letter **u**. The first name here is two characters and needs segmentation, and the common mistakes are to pronounce the **a** in **Zhang** as **b<u>a</u>t** or **zh** as **<u>z</u>oo**. |
| Danqi Chen | _dan ch-ee ch-uh-n_, where _uh_=**<u>a</u>gain** and **dan** sounds just like the English name Dan. Again the first name here is two characters. I personally find the commonly used pronunciation of **Chen** where **e** is pronounced like **b<u>e</u>t** a bit too flat, and the enunciated version where **D<u>a</u>n** sounds like **sp<u>a</u>** a bit too open. |
| Ziang Xie | _zzz ah-ng sh-y-eh_, where _zzz_=prolonging the consonant a bit, _ah_=**sp<u>a</u>**, and _eh_=**b<u>e</u>t**. This is a bit more difficult to get right, where the first name is actually two characters, and the last name has what sounds like a double-consonant leading sound. |

This [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Mandarin) is also a good reference with quick examples for pronunciation.

### Footnotes
[^1]: Others, like [Tongyong Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongyong_Pinyin) and [Wade-Giles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade%E2%80%93Giles) are still in use for historical reasons. Also, note that not all Chinese names were romanized from Mandarin (which Pinyin is for) -- some names come from Cantonese and other Chinese languages and it's not always easy to tell.
[^2]: Focusing more on the "standard" American accent here because this is the accent that I personally get the most samples for (and thus am more confident about vowel/consonant mappings and common mistakes in). However, much of this is applicable to other accents as well, especially for consonant mapping.

title: AI is the New Rocket Science
description: >
    AI science of today has astonishing similarities to rocket science in its prime days, if one pays close attention to history. What are some of these, and what can the history of rocket science tell us about the fate of AI?

"It's not like it's rocket science!" Exclaims a character in your favorite sitcom/drama/book, who then explains to another character how simple something they are asking. Rocket science has been widely used in the everyday (American) English dialog to mean something incomprehensibly complex more often in the sarcastic negative meaning, much like how "heavenly script" is used in Chinese (and [by transitivity](https://itsallgreektoanna.wordpress.com/2016/05/28/its-all-chinese-to-me/), the one of the most incomprehensible languages in the world).

## commonalities
* both not so much "science". clouding the amount of good systems engineering
    * so much that's going on is not science (both in the sense that some science-looking work are still very shallow as far as scientific understanding goes, and in the sense that a ton of program management, business administration, architecture and engineering marvels go into the advances of each)
* both partly motivated by the potential of dual use
* both overly mystified by (some of) their practitioners
* both overly romanticized by the general public

## AI science is also unique
* The reference is elusive and has been evolving as we tackle each "crown jewel / holy grail of AI" for that particular historical context (yes, real progress has been made towards general-purpose AI systems approaching or surpassing average human performance in many applications, not denying that)

## What can AI Practitioners Learn from the History of Rocket Science?

"It's not like it's rocket science!" Exclaims a character in your favorite sitcom/drama/book, who then explains to another character how simple something they are asking. Rocket science has been widely used in the everyday (American) English dialog to mean something incomprehensibly complex more often in the sarcastic negative meaning, much like how "heavenly script" is used in Chinese (and [by transitivity](https://itsallgreektoanna.wordpress.com/2016/05/28/its-all-chinese-to-me/), the one of the most incomprehensible languages in the world).

On the surface (pun intended), the appeal of rockets and space technology is so easy to grasp for the general public, and has since been sensationalized and romanticized by numerous artists in any shape and form imaginable, from [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Films_set_in_outer_space) ([Oscar-wining ones too](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/)), [songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Songs_about_outer_space) (including this [oldie-goodie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Oddity)), to endless [books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Space_exploration_novels), to just name a few categories. Even without extensive educational efforts from pop science and space agencies, it is not hard to see the appeal of space and space technology. After all, every launch marks the lift off of humongous space vehicles weight a massive ball of fire, into the eternal void full of undiscovered wonders of our physical universe. The nerve-racking challenges in weightlessness, the cool but memorable jargons ("extravehicular activity" sounds unfamiliarly cool with an easy acronym, while "natural language processing" sounds like a meat plant that turns books into dictionaries[^1]), the smart-looking lead engineers and scientists in the huge mission control rooms, and the (oddly never soundless but) expansive black backdrop of the universe all contribute to the mystery and gravitas. Add black holes and special relativity (and the Nolan brothers), and boom, [instant Oscars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)).

On the other hand, the portrayal of AI (really mostly just robots) has largely fallen into two tropes: the bad AI deceiving humans and leading to our extinction, and the good, friendly, quirky, and often under-equipped AIs fighting these bad AIs along our side. Sometimes [a bit of both](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)). (AI) programmers on the silver screen are either staring at walls of JavaScript scrolling by when they smash their laptop keyboard randomly (which, can someone talk them into at least replacing with Python?), or are token nerds that gets killed off after offering the one critical smart comment they offer the muscular super-spy protagonist ([apparently I'm not the only one wondering](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Hollywood-portray-hackers-so-wrongly)).

Despite their vastly different public images, rocket science and AI science actually share a lot in common. Some are more obvious, so let us get those out of the way first.

**First, both are extremely capital-intensive and knowledge-intensive to build.** While the proliferation of AI today might give a different impression, the AI market largely remains an oligarchy, where a few well-funded top players dominates most of the leading-edge work. Even the David's in the news are Goliaths compared to most of the rest of the world in terms of access to computational resources and/or top research talent, especially if they are building much of the breakthrough from scratch.

**Second, both are applicable in a myriad of dual-use situations**, which invites heavy government scrutiny if not also investment, media hype in the name of national security and pride, as well as (sometimes misguided) public interest. AI science is more and more resembling its rocket relative at its high time 70 years ago, where DeepSeek is actively compared to the "Sputnik moment" by the media, no less.[^2]

**Third, both are overly romanticized by the general public.** This is manifested mainly in two ways -- one where fiction works make interesting extrapolations of the technology into the future while grossly missing the mark on some things that we see as obvious decades later (e.g., the phone prediction below from 1956); another where we tend to amplify the voices of a few people that are associated with the technical breakthroughs, who are usually not the most versed in the technologies they represent. One example is early astronauts. While there is no doubt about their bravery to sit in their tin cans (which is what they were by today's standards), they are highly trained to follow a very dedicated mission protocol designed and maintained by numerous engineers to account for all foreseeable issues during the mission, with a booster, a vehicle, electronics, etc. designed and built by hundreds if not thousands of highly capable and deeply knowledgeable scientists and engineers. Yet we end up mostly remembering the "One small step" quote --- pretty much the same thing is also happening today.

There are some less-discussed commonalities between rocket science and today's AI science, as well, and you might not be expecting some of these if you haven't paid close enough attention.

**First, "science" is really a misnomer for both.** To be clear, this is not to say that no science is happening within these disciplines: to the contrary, when there is abundant public interest, funding and potential applications to practical problems, scientific research and discoveries proliferate. But the term "science" clouds the amount of good systems engineering that goes into both, especially when we witness the takeoff of a product that causes global sensation. So much that is going on is not science, both in the sense that some science-looking work are still very primitive as far as scientific understanding goes, and in the sense that a ton of program management, business administration, architecture and engineering marvels go into these advances, which would have been impossible were it left to just a handful of smart scientists alone. It is worth noting that even in top academic labs, oftentimes the line between very cutting-edge scientific advances and very sophisticated engineering is blurred at best, since these disciplines can deliver so much practical value before everything is perfectly well-understood about them, as long as the good recipes can yield reproducible results and be built upon.

**Second, we tend to take too narrow of a view of their potential (positive) implications.** Both rocket science and AI science are complex enough to involve the collaboration of people from many different disciplines coming together, and this effect sometimes payoff in ways that are difficult to imagine when the technology is being developed to solve the problem at hand. What do a LASIK surgeon, a newborn baby, and an architect designing a new skyscraper have in common? They are likely using some technology that [originated from NASA's space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spin-off_technologies). While not all of these are directly related to the original problems the technology was originally designed to solve, this is a great illustration of the far- and wide-reaching positive technological implications of solving complex engineering problems. In AI, this effect is likely going to be more pronounced, since it does not only require technological advances to *build* AI and *use* AI (this is what crowd-sourcing, light-based chips, and massive yet efficient storage clusters have in common), but strong AI artifacts can also be leveraged to uplift the productivity and innovation in many other disciplines (AI for science and AI for AI), catalyzing more emergent technological leaps.

**Third, both are sometimes overly mystified by (some of) their practitioners.** With great powers, comes sometimes not great responsibilities, but great insecurities. With vested (geo-)political, economical, financial, and sometimes reputational interests in maintaining the scarcity of the technology developed, both rocket science and AI science can sometimes be unnecessarily complicated in the public narrative and mystified by their practitioners. While from a short-term perspective this might be beneficial for the individuals and groups involved, in the long term, this is usually a net loss for society and humanity as a whole.

As we recognize these commonalities between AI and rocket sciences, there are a lot of lessons we can inherit from our space-exploring precursors back in the day:

* Strong leadership and clear vision
* Collaborate with pooled resources, not divided and fragmented. openness and collaboration win "The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds." -- JFK 1962 speech at Rice
* Set moonshot goals: challenging yet plausible within the timeframe allotted -> more exciting advances than imaginable from the onset
* embrace and empower cross-discipline collaboration

## AI science is also unique
* The reference is elusive and has been evolving as we tackle each "crown jewel / holy grail of AI" for that particular historical context (yes, real progress has been made towards general-purpose AI systems approaching or surpassing average human performance in many applications, not denying that)

## What can AI Practitioners Learn from the History of Rocket Science?

"It's not like it's rocket science!" Exclaims a character in your favorite sitcom/drama/book, who then explains to another character how simple something they are asking. Rocket science has been widely used in the everyday (American) English dialog to mean something incomprehensibly complex more often in the sarcastic negative meaning, much like how "heavenly script" is used in Chinese (and [by transitivity](https://itsallgreektoanna.wordpress.com/2016/05/28/its-all-chinese-to-me/), the one of the most incomprehensible languages in the world).

On the surface (pun intended), the appeal of rockets and space technology is so easy to grasp for the general public, and has since been sensationalized and romanticized by numerous artists in any shape and form imaginable, from [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Films_set_in_outer_space) ([Oscar-wining ones too](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/)), [songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Songs_about_outer_space) (including this [oldie-goodie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Oddity)), endless [books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Space_exploration_novels), to just name a few categories. Even without extensive educational efforts from pop science and space agencies, it is not hard to see the appeal of space and space technology. After all, every launch marks the lift off of humongous space vehicles in a massive ball of fire, into the eternal void full of undiscovered wonders of our physical universe. The nerve-racking challenges in weightlessness, the cool but memorable jargons ("extravehicular activity" sounds cool, has a easy-to-remember acronym. "cardiopulmonary resuscitation" has no chance), the smart-looking lead engineers and scientists in the huge mission control rooms, and the (oddly never soundless but) expansive black backdrop of the universe all contribute to the mystery and gravitas. Add black holes and special relativity (and the Nolan brothers,) and boom, [instant Oscars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)).

On the other hand, the portrayal of AI (really mostly just robots) has largely fallen into two tropes: the bad AI deceiving humans and leading to our extinction, and the good, friendly, quirky, and often under-equipped AIs fighting these bad AIs along our side. Sometimes [a bit of both](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)). (AI) programmers on the silver screen are either staring at walls of JavaScript scrolling by when they smash their laptop keyboard randomly (which, can someone talk them into at least replacing with Python?), or are token nerds that gets killed off after offering the one critical smart comment they offer the muscular super-spy protagonist ([apparently I'm not the only one wondering](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Hollywood-portray-hackers-so-wrongly)).

Despite their vastly different public images, rocket science and AI science actually share a lot in common. Some are more obvious, so let us get those out of the way first. First, both are extremely capital-intensive and knowledge-intensive to build. While the proliferation of AI today might give a different impression, the AI market largely remains an oligarchy, where a few well-funded top players dominates most of the leading edge work. Second, both are applicable in a myriad of dual-use situations, which invites heavy government scrutiny if not also investment, media hype in the name of national security and pride, as well as (sometimes misguided) public interest. AI science is more and more resembling its rocket relative at its high time 70 years ago, where DeepSeek is actively compared to the "Sputnik moment" by the media.[^1] Third,



## commonalities
* both not so much "science". clouding the amount of good systems engineering
    * so much that's going on is not science (both in the sense that some science-looking work are still very shallow as far as scientific understanding goes, and in the sense that a ton of program management, business administration, architecture and engineering marvels go into the advances of each)
* both partly motivated by the potential of dual use
* both overly mystified by (some of) their practitioners
* both overly romanticized by the general public

## AI science is also unique
* The reference is elusive and has been evolving as we tackle each "crown jewel / holy grail of AI" for that particular historical context (yes, real progress has been made towards general-purpose AI systems approaching or surpassing average human performance in many applications, not denying that)

## What can AI Practitioners Learn from the History of Rocket Science?

He is also a fan of movies, and always dreamt of directing movies on his own. His first try as a movie director (probably only available for Mainland China, sorry for that): <a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTM4MTQ1Njgw.html" target="_blank">AI.恋 (A.I.'s Love)</a>. Also his documentary editing work: <a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjMxNzMwNjg4.html" target="_blank">拾年 (Ten Years)</a>. Sorry but neither has a English subtitle. Recently, he also finished the screenplay for the graduation DV, which is being shot and will soon be shown at the Students' Festival of School of Software.  <br /><br />

He also designed some posters, PPT templates (most of his ppt templates are original, if not that he lacks time preparing), and websites (Tiandi Survey System, Office Website of Tsinghua Network Support Center, Quanr Microblog, etc. See <a href="javascript:bannerclick('projects')">Projects</a>), which include this very homepage (New edition in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)" target="_blank">Metro</a> style).

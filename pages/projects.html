<h4>Quanr Microblog<div class="finished" /></h4>
Quanr Microblog (which sadly is no longer hosted by the competition website) is the course project of course <i>Software Engineering</i> as well as a work competing in the 4th Software Design Contest, which won a Third Prize. In this project, Peng was the <b>team leader</b>, who coordinated the 5-people team and cooperated with his teammates to finish the system, which has many functions as well as an OAuth SDK and a mobile client.

<h4>Portable Automatic Exam Scoring System<div class="finished" /></h4>
This project is the course project of the <i>Embedded System Design and Applications</i> course. In this project, Peng individually developed a scoring system based on computer vision in Windows CE. Compared to traditional complex automatic scoring systems, this system can give user the freedom to design her own machine-read exam paper, and score with only a camera and a computer.

<h4>TexTriBute: A Text Retrieval System under Distributed Framework<div class="finished" /></h4>
This project is the course project of course <i>Advanced Data Structure</i>. In this project, Peng and his teammate constructed a distributed storage/computation structure, which provided both data redundancy and more efficient query, for indices of a given text corpus. The text are indexed with Latent Semantic Index, in order to provide a content-based search result.

<h4>Semantic-Based Query Optimization on Hyper-SQL Database<div class="finished" /></h4>
This project is the course project of course <i>Principles of Database Systems</i>, in which Peng is the <b>team leader</b> of the team. This projects intergrated three semantic-based query optimization into Hyper SQL Database (H-SQL DB), an open source database management system, namely join elimination, empty query detection and query condition simplification.

<h4>Semantic-Directed LR Grammar Analyzer<div class="finished" /></h4>
This project is the course project of the course <i>Principles of Compilers</i>, in which Peng colaborated with 3 other teammates and built a LR Grammar Analyzer. Similar to famous LR analyzers like <a href="antlr" target="_blank">ANTLR</a>, this project is able to generate the source Java code of a RL parser. What differs this project from traditional LR analyzer is that it provide a interface for semantic-directed computation of properties of symbols, based on which a calculator can be constructed from a property-tagged RL grammar.

<h4>Regular Language Analyzer<div class="finished" /></h4>
This project is the course project of the <i>Normal Language and Automata</i> course. The analyzer can analyze the input regular expression (regex) and generate a corresponding Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA). Afterwards, the NFA is converted to a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), which is more efficient in program implementation. Finally, the DFA is optimized to minimize the number of states and transitions. This project can generate an regex engine for real use in, for example, lexer in compilers.

<h4>Geoxiom : A quasi-natural language and compiler of professional geometric-chart construction.<div class="finished" /></h4>
<i>Geoxiom</i> is a quasi-natural language and the corresponding compiler of professional geometric-chart construction. It generates vector-based charts of geometric elements used in industrial publication field, such as paper writing and book documentation. The scripting language is quasi-natural, meaning that it is similar to natural descriptive languages of geometric objects in mathematics.

<h4>Economical Road Construction Planning Based on Geographical Information<div class="finished" /></h4>
This is the course project of the course <i>Discrete Mathematics II</i>, which mainly focused on the graph theory and related algorithms. This project is a one-person project. Peng finished this project by modeling geographical information with mesh, and then applying shortest path algorithms to the modeled mesh. Besides, he made use of the course project for Computer Graphics and offered realistic visualization in this project.

<h4>Car Detection from Parking Lot Picture<div class="finished" /></h4>
This project is part of the problem of Sponsor Group of the <i>2nd Software Design Contest of Tsinghua University</i>, which he finished on his own. In this problem, a picture of a parking lot is given, where the number of cars in the picture as well as their positions are required to be detected with the program. He and his teammates <b>ranked 2nd</b> out of about 10 teams in the Final, and won the Award of Merit in this contest.

<h4>Information Exchange System<div class="finished" /></h4>
Information Exchange System is a project supported by the <i>Software Students' Research Training (SSRT) Project</i>, in which Peng is the <b>team leader</b>. This project aims to solve the problem of information boom and the often low efficiency and effectiveness of information exchange. With each post tagged with a type tag, posted to a special group of person, and marked with priority, this system is more efficient than ever.

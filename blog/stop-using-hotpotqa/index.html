Centuries later, historians of the Solar System will look back at this point in time, and only then, could they fully recognize the watershed moment that it was. What was formerly known as Year 2025 in the Common Era is now more colloquially known as Year 1 of the Agent Era.</p> <p><em>– An attempt at a Three Body-esque sci-fi narrative about AI agents</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Agents, agents everywhere. From countless startups to innumerable social media posts, AI agents are creeping up in your IDEs, your browsers, and perhaps places you are not even looking or consciously aware. Clearly the dominating narrative in artificial intelligence in 2025, “agents”, transitive by the share of the public discourse AI is taking up, is firmly one of the most discussed topics in humanity’s collective consciousness this year. The fact that we do not even seem to have a shared definition for what AI agents are does not seem to deter us. We all seem to have developed a warm and buzzy feeling about them, and sincerely believe (or hope) that agents are “the next big thing that changes everything as we know it”.</p> <p>If you are following frontier AI agents research closely, you might have come across a benchmark called HotpotQA, that is somewhat often discussed in these research works. What is HotpotQA, and what does it have to do with the AI agents today?</p> <h3 id="hotpotqa">HotpotQA</h3> <p>Back in 2018, some awesome collaborators (from CMU and Université de Montréal) and I published a paper called HotpotQA, which features a novel (at the time) idea of question answering through multi-step reasoning in the wild. Since its publication, HotpotQA has helped fuel some of the early ideas in modern AI agents.</p> <p>Consider the question <em>“What government position was held by the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell?”</em> To answer this question, you’d first need to figure out <em>“who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell”</em>, before you can answer what government position she held (it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shirley Temple</a>, and her position was Chief of Protocol of the United States).</p> <p>This was a time before <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BERT</a> and any of the decoder-only breakthroughs in large language models we take for granted today (e.g., <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GPT‑2</a>, back when version numbers were still monotonically increasing integers). At that time, most of the AI systems that can answer questions from a large collection of text (like Wikipedia) follow a <strong>simple, scripted recipe</strong>: retrieve a handful of passages from the corpus with the question, and shovel them into a neural network with the question to get the answer.</p> <p>HotpotQA pioneered a class of AI tasks that requires the AI system to <strong>autonomously</strong> perform multiple steps of reasoning in an open-domain setting, where scripted approaches no longer worked well. Since, now, each question in HotpotQA requires at least two passages from separate Wikipedia pages to answer. These questions are designed so that often at least one of these won’t surface if you searched with the question itself. What is more,different questions use different natural language reasoning patterns that present challenges to a single script that works for all.</p> <p>In its early days, researchers often challenged the motivation for HotpotQA by observing that the questions themselves are oftentimes artificial, and that users can still break their complex questions down into subquestions manually so that existing AI systems can handle them. Looking back after a few years, our answer to these very valid considerations seems to have stood the test of time:</p> <blockquote> <p>We would still like to build AI systems that <strong>can</strong> solve more challenging problems through more autonomous reasoning and acting, rather than always relying on humans to cope with the limitations of the AI systems that are currently available.</p> </blockquote> <p>HotpotQA, despite some of its limitations, was a step in the right direction to challenge the envelope of possible AI system capabilities, where we essentially over-sampled a group of small but challenging problems to stress test how well our systems perform.</p> <p>In my own follow up work a year later, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07000" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GoldEn Retriever</a>, we explored a prototype of such an AI system. Instead of following a scripted procedure, GoldEn Retriever proposes its own search queries based on the original question and whatever passages have been retrieved from the previous iteration (initially empty). This allows the system to autonomously focus on information related to <em>“Kiss and Tell”</em> in the first iteration of information gathering, then use the retrieved information about the movie, combined with the original question, to redirect its focus to <em>“Shirley Temple”</em> to solve the question by going beyond the information immediately available in the original question. This is a proof of concept for the ideas behind what would later become agentic retrieval and deep research, where the AI system is provided with strong agency in determining what information to gather at each step, gather information for multiple steps, and then formulate a coherent answer given all the context that is provided.</p> <h3 id="why-you-should-stop-using-just-hotpotqa-for-agents-research">Why you should stop using (just) HotpotQA for agents research</h3> <p>Four score and seven months later, looking back on this journey, it is truly humbling to see the body of research work that this dataset has helped enable. I have constantly discovered new inspirations from the ingenuity of the community that works on AI agents, some of which have found HotpotQA useful as a testbed.</p> <p>However, when used in isolation, the evaluation that HotpotQA provides is no longer adequate for today’s agentic systems.</p> <p>First, the task <strong>output format and evaluation metric</strong> are a little outdated. Like many question answering datasets of its day, HotpotQA is an extractive question answering dataset following the pioneering work in SQuAD, which means that the answer came directly from a substring in the Wikipedia context that supports the answer. While this leads to relatively easy-to-implement and objective evaluation metric, it leads to a format that is no longer natural for today’s generative AI systems (or to real users), and is limited in its ability to evaluate semantically equivalent or other potentially feasible but unannotated answers. For instance, in our example in the previous section, a system predicted answer <em>“The actress in question is Shirley Temple, who held the position of Chief of Protocol of the United States”</em>, while being perfectly sound to a human user, would not have received full credit in the exact match or F1 scores, because it provides extra information that the specific answer format did not allow.</p> <p>Second, the <strong>task is not realistic enough</strong>, in the sense that it bakes in the assumption that <em>every single</em> question requires multiple steps of reasoning to arrive at the answer. In reality, this cannot be determined just by looking at the question itself, but also depends on the knowledge sources that are available, somewhat akin to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">halting problem</a> of programs (you cannot always determine whether a program will terminate on all possible inputs). In our example, it is plausible (though unlikely) that the Wikipedia page for Kiss and Tell mentions Shirley Temple’s government capacity of Chief of Protocol of the United States, for instance, if this position temporally overlaps with the film’s making, or has had an effect on the artistic decision-making in its production. In that case, only a single step of retrieval and reasoning would have been sufficient, and doing more risks introducing more noise for the model to cut through. In my 2021 follow-up work, we attempted to address this benchmarking problem by coming up with a unified single- and multi-hop question answering dataset with the same underlying knowledge corpus, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12527" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BeerQA</a>,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> alongside an autonomous system that performs retrieve-and-read for as many steps as needed for the question at hand, given the information retrieved so far. This more closely emulates the scenario where AI agents are being deployed: before exploring potential approaches to solve the given problem with the knowledge and tools provided, it is impossible to perfectly predict the complexity of the problem ahead of time.</p> <p>Third, the <strong>task is relatively contrived</strong>, and reflects only a small slice of what humans would like to delegate to intelligent systems. Question answering is at the core of human needs to gather (and synthesize) knowledge, which undoubtedly improves upon the previous generation of technology that solves this problem, represented by powerful search engines. However, in many cases, knowledge gathering itself is not an end, but a means to an underlying one. One can gather knowledge to assist with more challenging decision-making, to educate oneself or others, to explore the boundary of adjacent knowledge, or even to serve as the basis of knowledge to help accomplish certain tasks, to name a few. As the capabilities of our AI models and systems improve, we should not stop at holding ourselves to solving only parts of these problems, but more aggressively explore their end-to-end solutions.</p> <p>Finally, as is the case with any benchmark, <strong>approaches overfit the benchmark over time</strong>. Almost everyone that has worked on HotpotQA is probably familiar with some of the first 10 dev set examples by now (our Shirley Temple example being one of them), and powerful large language models have also likely seen the entire development set with the correct answers in its training. One unfortunate fact with benchmarks, especially in an unchecked SOTA-or-reject publication culture, is also that researchers are motivated to do whatever they need to hillclimb on the benchmarks that they work on. This has often led to the antipattern that a general-sounding approach is heavily tailored for different benchmarks to achieve the best results on those benchmarks. This is especially troubling for works that claim to build general-purpose AI agents that function for a wide range of agentic tasks, because such customization clearly provides unfair advantage based on information that is not derived by the agent, and therefore undermines the validity of any such generality claims.</p> <h3 id="what-to-do-instead">What to do instead</h3> <p>Having revisited the limitations that HotpotQA has, what can we do instead, as a community, to make true progress towards autonomous AI agents? Some of the answers lie in the four limitations I listed above. Instead of writing a carefully crafted research statement, I will just try to dump some of the ideas in a semi-consistent pile of text.</p> <p>First, <strong>avoid heavy customization of your agent design to each benchmark it is tested on</strong>. With the advances of modern foundation models, we might be able to get away without dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning, and really revisit the dream of artificial intelligence – a human-like algorithm that “just works” on any problem we throw at it, without excessive human involvement or problem-specific hyperparameter tuning. Like scientists in nature sciences, perhaps we should set out to look for the “universal equations” where one set of constants govern everything in our observable universe. This also helps avoid the problem of working on unrealistic settings (e.g., all problems are exclusively multi-hop or complex), since now your AI system is held to the standard of solving a wide range of tasks with a single implementation.</p> <p>Second, <strong>work on agentic tasks beyond simple knowledge gathering</strong>. There has been a myriad of new agentic benchmarks that focus on evaluating complex reasoning behaviors and autonomous decision making. Along similar lines to HotpotQA’s theme of context understanding and knowledge gathering are benchmarks like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12983" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GAIA</a> that stress test agent capabilities in leveraging a diverse set of tools to gather correct information form the cyber world to answer questions. In the meantime, it has never been a better time to work on agentic tasks and benchmarking that evaluate agent capabilities to <strong>do</strong> various tasks and have real-world effects. Benchmarks like <a href="https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/Online-Mind2Web?tab=readme-ov-file" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Online Mind2Web</a>, <a href="https://os-world.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OSWorld</a>, <a href="https://webarena.dev/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">WebArena</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07718" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">WorkArena</a>, among others, evaluate AI agent’s ability to perform actions in a real or simulated digital environment to achieve goals that not only derive answers to questions, but also sometimes change the state of the world in desirable ways. A natural extension of these digital agents into the physical world is embodied AI agents, where, despite many impressive breakthroughs coming from computer vision and robotics, much of the exploration is still in very infancy stages.</p> <p>Third, <strong>with capable agents, there’s unprecedented space for discovery of new tasks that we couldn’t imagine working, new interactions we didn’t think mature enough, or those that they don’t do well yet</strong>. In the realm of things that we couldn’t imagine working, are various creative works that leverage language-based AI agents’ role-playing capabilities to simulate a well-organized group of humans working towards a goal, or simply a loosely organized group going about their “lives” that exhibit interesting social and/or economic behaviors (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AI towns</a>, for example). With maturing AI capabilities, there will also be user-agent and agent-agent interactions we didn’t think possible a few years ago, e.g., immersive multimodal collaboration between humans and AIs to solve problems in the real world, where the AI is not merely actuating human instructions, but more and more serving as an autonomous counter-party and making autonomous decisions independent of their human counterparts. There will also always be tasks or capabilities that the emergent generalization of today’s AI models cannot cover very well yet, due to limited resource availability or fundamental limitations in the workhorse technologies we use today. It will be particularly exciting to piggyback on the AI capabilities that we have today to find the ones that are still lacking,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> where reliable and robust evaluation will always be at the forefront of these challenges (building datasets, sound evaluation techniques and defining new categories of tasks are important, but admittedly I am biased). I still stand by the predictions I made a little over two years ago in the tweet below, only reality is a lot more exciting than I had imagined.</p> <center> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Could the fast development and wide adoption of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gpt4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#gpt4</a> and friends actually lead to a Linguistic Renaissance?</p>— Peng Qi (@qi2peng2) <a href="https://twitter.com/qi2peng2/status/1635816369509007363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 15, 2023</a> </blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </center> <p>Last but not least, <strong>with great adoption, comes great responsibilities</strong>. As AI agents improve in their capabilities to solve real-world tasks that people encounter in their everyday work and life, they will inevitably see wider and wider adoption. How can we make sure these agents do not do undesirable things when they are put in the hands of users? How do we make sure they are transparent enough so that the user can understand how they do what they do, and controllable enough that should the user need to intervene, their behavior can be meaningfully influenced? How can we make them run more efficiently and robustly, reducing their power footprint and improving user experience in the same time? How do we make sure the interface that these agents expose to users is actually providing the right amount of information and control, so that well-meaning users can accomplish their goals unhindered, while malevolent users cannot use them to cause outsized harm? A lot of these questions stand at the blurry boundary between cutting edge research and real-world applications, which offers unprecedented opportunities for academic and industry researchers to collaborate and work on groundbreaking problems together (plug: <a href="https://www.orby.ai/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Orby</a> is doing a lot of these and beyond, consider joining us!).</p> <h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3> <p>The progress of science in artificial intelligence goes hand-in-hand with our ability to discover and clearly define new “intelligent” problems, however elusive this process might seem.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Gone are the days where a few benchmarks occupy the attention of half of the NLP field for a decade, but the importance of identifying crucial, high-quality, and lasting research problems never fades. I try to ask myself this question all the time, and I would encourage every AI researcher to do the same from time to time: what is the problem that we are <strong>actually</strong> solving here? It is probably not just a new model architecture, just hill-climbing on a bunch of datasets, or just designing and publishing new shiny benchmarks, despite what it looks like on the surface and what the buzz says. One answer that I inevitably stumble upon as I think in depth about this, is that we are fundamentally solving for the underlying <strong>human problems</strong>, and anything short of it is a detour or temporary milestone.</p> <h4 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h4> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>Because you get different flavors of beer by adding different levels of hops, among other things.

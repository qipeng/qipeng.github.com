		  problem that abounds in languages with complex morphology,
		  we include a character-based word representation that uses
		  an LSTM to produce embeddings from sequences of characters.
		  Our system was ranked first according to all five relevant
		  metrics for the system: UPOS tagging (93.09%), XPOS tagging
		  (82.27%), unlabeled attachment score (81.30%), labeled
		  attachment score (76.30%), and content word labeled
